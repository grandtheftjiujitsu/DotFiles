DEFAULT) are done when needed, reducing video memory and improving performance.\r\n* Refactored and rewritten presentation and swapchain code\r\n    * Includes support for vsync + proper fullscreen w/ mode setting. Fixes other issues also.\r\n* Contiguous surface allocation\r\n    * Improves stuttering in games which spam and abuse CreateTexture (eg. A Hat in Time, League of Legends)\r\n* Improve determining when we should wait on textures.\r\n* Optimized image views by avoiding creating duplicates and instead dually referencing existing ones if SRGB formats do not exist for the given D3D9 format.\r\n\r\n**New Features**\r\n* Build\r\n    * You can now choose what modules to build, if you so desire.\r\n* Queries\r\n    * Minor query optimisations\r\n    * Implement D3DQUERYTYPE_VERTEXSTATS\r\n* Alpha to Coverage\r\n    * Supports both the AMD/NV driver hacks\r\n    * Fixes hair in Final Fantasy [some roman numeral].\r\n    * May improve appearance of other games also\r\n* Cursor Position Setting\r\n    * The cursor position is correctly set/flushed when the application desires (immediate or at Present time)\r\n* Partial support for Presentation Rects\r\n     * Fixes the fact that A Hat in Time doesn't recreate its backbuffer when making the resolution go down. (pls fix devs :heart:)\r\n* Resolve Z\r\n    * The AMD resolve-z hack has been implemented.\r\n* Initial Data\r\n    * Added support for CreateTexture InitialData in the shared handle for D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM.\r\n    * Fixes CS:GO\r\n* *GDI Interop*\r\n    * There is now *experimental* support for GetDC/ReleaseDC.\r\n* Version Info\r\n    * Correct version info is now reported in the DLL, this should satisfy some anti-cheats.\r\n* GetStreamSourceFreq got implemented (by Rhedox)\r\n* Basic support for D3D9Ex\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* D3D9\r\n    * We now hold a reference to the auto depth stencil created by device Reset, some applications depended on this (ie. Gothic III)\r\n    * Minor query fixes\r\n    * Fixes for initializing both regular and lazy alloced resources\r\n        * Fixes \"punch card\" issue in The Sims 3\r\n    * Fix for stride returned for ATI1/2 formats not respecting Mip\r\n    * Don't apply view sample swizzle on depth views (fixes some validation errors)\r\n    * Fixed vsync + fullscreen issues\r\n    * Corrected some cursor bugs where it would vanish in, for eg. GW2\r\n    * In theory, some OOM issues may be corrected.\r\n    * Fixed R8G8B8 fixup not working properly in some instances.\r\n    * Fix mode order being incorrect.\r\n    * Some extra undocumented interfaces are now stubbed and exposed (ie. Direct3DCreateShaderValidator9, PGSPError, etc)\r\n    * Corrected refcounting for surfaces and fixed a bug where sometimes invalid memory would be used/deleted there.\r\n    * Fixed a bug where UpdateSurface would pass an incorrect extent to Vk.\r\n    * Fixed a bug where RestoreDisplayMode would fail\r\n    * Fixed FP precision being set invalidly on x64 MSVC builds.\r\n    * Fixes for multisample state not being bound in some instances causing no rendering.\r\n* DXSO (Shaders)\r\n    * Fixed a GPU hang in some games on RADV. This has been fixed with discard deferral.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n**Please** do not use wine's `d3d9x` or `d3dcompiler` with d9vk.
