This introduces a number of new API features, some which are supported by DXVK if the underlying Vulkan driver supports the corresponding features.\r\n\r\nThe following features are optional and are currently **not** supported:\r\n- **D3D11.2:** Tiled Resources\r\n- **D3D11.3:** Conservative Rasterization\r\n- **D3D11.3:** Rasterizer Ordered Views\r\n\r\nThese features may be implemented in the future in case any games make use of them.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a crash in **Plants vs Zombies - Battle for Neighborville**, which requires at least a D3D11.3 runtime.\r\n\r\n### DXGI runtime interface\r\nTo match the D3D11.4 update, DXGI interfaces were updated to **DXGI 1.5**.\r\nThis allows application to query for HDR support. HDR itself is **not** supported.\r\n\r\nSupport for **GDI interop** with DXGI surfaces was added to fix an issue with the **Rockstar Game Launcher**. Note that the launcher itself also requires fixes to Wine's Direct2D implementation, see #1196.\r\n\r\n### Resource mapping improvements\r\nThe `d3d11.allowMapFlagNoWait` option is now enabled by default, which may improve performance in certain games. An issue that would prevent it from working correctly in **The Witcher 3** and other games has been fixed, and synchronization now behaves more like it would on a native D3D11 driver.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This change may introduce regressions. **When reporting a bug, please check whether setting `d3d11.allowMapFlagNoWait = False` in the configuration file fixes your problem** and include this information in your bug report.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n- Fixed a potential performance issue in games making heavy use of Deferred Contexts, such as **Dark Souls III** and **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**.\r\n- More accurate resource tracking may in some cases lower CPU overhead

This requires a **winevulkan** update, as well as the following driver versions:\r\n- **AMD**: Not supported\r\n- **Intel**: Mesa 19.2-git\r\n- **Nvidia**: 418.52.14 (Vulkan beta)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the previous early-discard optimization which works without this extension has been enabled on RADV with the [ACO](https://github.com/daniel-schuermann/mesa) compiler backend. It is not enabled with the default LLVM backend due to LLVM bugs.\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous presentation\r\nIn order to reduce stalls on the main rendering thread, presentation is now being performed on the command submission thread that was introduced in DXVK 1.2. This can improve performance especially in scenarios with high frame rates and when command submission is expensive.\r\n\r\nOne game that benefits is **Quake Champions** on AMD GPUs.\r\n\r\n### Resource upload chages\r\nIf available, DXVK will now use the copy engines of the Vulkan device for initial resource uploads. This may slightly improve frame time consistency if a game loads a large number of textures during gameplay. Currently, this is only supported on the AMDVLK and Nvidia drivers.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Removed busy-waiting during presentation. This change will most likely not affect performance, but can reduce CPU load considerably in GPU-limited scenarios.\r\n- Improved error logging in out-of-memory conditions (PR #1112)\r\n- Improved MSVC compatibility (PR #945, PR #1110)\r\n- Fixed incorrect behaviour when an already mapped image subresource gets mapped again. Encountered in **Final Fantasy XIV**.\r\n- **Scrap Mechanic**: Fixed crash caused by incorrect `RSGetViewport` behaviour (#1116, PR #1117)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/18249194","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/18249194/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/18249194/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.2.3","id":18249194,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE4MjQ5MTk0","tag_name":"v1.2.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.2.3","draft":false,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-06-26T16:53:35Z","published_at":"2019-06-26T20:32:38Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/13417708","id":13417708,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDEzNDE3NzA4","name":"dxvk-1.2.3.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":5205245,"download_count":23608,"created_at":"2019-06-26T20:30:22Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T20:30:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v1.2.3/dxvk-1.2.3.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v1.2.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v1.2.3","body":"### Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- Fixed bug that would cause some Unreal Engine 4 games to show error messages upon exit (PR #1104)\r\n- Fixed regression which would break texture loading in **World of Warships** and potentially other games (#1096)\r\n- More minor CPU overhead optimizations\r\n- Implemented [timestamp disjoint queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_query_data_timestamp_disjoint) properly to make measuring time on the GPU more robust.\r\n- Improved memory allocation behaviour under memory pressure.

Affected games include **Assassin's Creed Unity**.\r\n\r\n### Per-game configuration\r\nConfiguration options in `dxvk.conf` can now be limited to one single executable, which enables the use of one global DXVK configuration file rather than one file per game. Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Configuration) for details.\r\n\r\n### Query rework\r\nIn order to improve performance in **Unreal Engine 4** titles and others, Queries were re-implemented to allow for better GPU utilization. Since this is a widely used API feature, this change may affect many games.\r\n\r\n**Note:** For best performance, both your Wine version and graphics driver must support `VK_EXT_host_query_reset`. This extension is available since **Wine 4.5** as well as **Proton 4.2**, and on the following drivers:\r\n\r\n**AMD / Intel**: Mesa 19.1-git\r\n**Nvidia**: 418.52.05\r\n\r\n**Without this extension, certain games, such as Quake Champions, may perform significantly worse than with DXVK 1.0!**\r\n\r\n### Memory optimization\r\nIn games with a large number of shaders, memory utilization was reduced by using in-memory compression for shader code and avoiding unnecessary copies, which may slightly increase shader compile times.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This does not solve the out-of-memory issues with many 32-bit games, and does not affect VRAM utilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n- Improved compatibility to Wine's **Direct2D** implementation.\r\n- Minor optimizations for multisample resolve operations, presentation, and other things.\r\n- Fixed incorrect shader behaviour with unbound resources.\r\n- Fixed incorrect MSAA sample locations in shader code.\r\n- Fixed an issue causing flickering or artifacts on AMDVLK in some games.\r\n- Fixed various crashes when using the Windows version of RenderDoc inside wine (#877, PR #1037, PR #1038)\r\n- Fixed incorrect behaviour of `DrawAuto` with a non-zero vertex buffer offset. May affect **Space Engineers**.\r\n- **NieR:Automata:** Enable workaround for occational rendering issues on Nvidia GPUs (#1036)\r\n- **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice:** Improved overall performance by 5-10% compared to DXVK 1.0.3.\r\n- **SpellForce 3:** Fix water rendering issue, as well as crash on startup when using DXVK's D3D10 implementation (#1031)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/16770226","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/16770226/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/16770226/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.0.3","id":16770226,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2NzcwMjI2","tag_name":"v1.0.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.0.3","draft":false,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-04-15T10:46:04Z","published_at":"2019-04-15T15:32:11Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/12075099","id":12075099,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDEyMDc1MDk5","name":"dxvk-1.0.3.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":4867034,"download_count":34865,"created_at":"2019-04-15T15:12:28Z","updated_at":"2019-04-15T15:12:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v1.0.3/dxvk-1.0.3.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v1.0.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v1.0.3","body":"### Bug fixes and Improvements\r\n- DXVK DLLs now include version information, which some games may rely upon (#980, PR #993)\r\n- Fixed issue where hashing geometry shaders with stream output metadata would return undefined results.

On drivers which do not support `VK_EXT_transform_feedback`, DXVK now behaves as if that option was enabled, so that games such as Overwatch will continue to work as before on those drivers.\r\n- The `dxgi.maxFrameLatency` option, which was accidentally dropped in an earlier release, is now implemented again."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/14943780","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/14943780/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/14943780/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v0.95","id":14943780,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE0OTQzNzgw","tag_name":"v0.95","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 0.95","draft":false,"author":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-01-12T20:43:06Z","published_at":"2019-01-12T21:25:37Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/assets/10535481","id":10535481,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDEwNTM1NDgx","name":"dxvk-0.95.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"doitsujin","id":25567304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY3MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25567304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin","html_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doitsujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":4823367,"download_count":15498,"created_at":"2019-01-12T21:23:10Z","updated_at":"2019-01-12T21:23:18Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v0.95/dxvk-0.95.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/tarball/v0.95","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doitsujin/dxvk/zipball/v0.95","body":"**UPDATE:** This release **will** break some games.
